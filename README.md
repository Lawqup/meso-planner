# Usage

Given a set of exercises and days of the week, builds an exercise plan that matches the following criteria (in the following order of importance)

1. Don't train muscles before they're done recovering from the last session
2. Acheive a similar workout length per day 
3. Maximize metabolite buildup by placing similarly targeting exercises close to eachother in one workout (this should naturally make "push days" or "leg days" if possible)
